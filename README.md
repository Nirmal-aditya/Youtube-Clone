# Youtube-Clone


I recreated the YouTube homepage from scratch using HTML and CSS, capturing its familiar layout and design. Every element, from the search bar and trending videos to the recommended content section, was meticulously cloned to closely resemble the original. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web development, as I successfully emulated the look and feel of one of the internet's most popular platforms while honing my HTML and CSS skills.
